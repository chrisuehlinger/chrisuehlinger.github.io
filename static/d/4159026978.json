I don't have a video of this one, and my slides are a bit incomplete (it was heavily demo-focused), so I'd recommend checking out the blog post instead."],"id":"UNSHATTERING","title":"Unshattering the Audience: Building Theatre on the Web in 2020","clips":[]},{"company":"charmCityJS, February 2019","description":["At this point I had only done projections for two shows (Rocky and Thank You, Dad) but a lot of the concepts I cover in here (particularly ARKit and basic WebRTC stuff) formed the basis for a lot of my future projections work as well. This is also the only talk I've done that was recorded at the meetup where it was given, so I recommend checking that out."],"id":"THETIMEOUTAGAIN","title":"Let's Do The Timeout Again: Using Javascript to make Projections for Theatre","clips":[{"height":9,"id":"timeout-clip","src":"https://cdn.chrisuehlinger.com/show-videos/timeout-clip.mp4","type":"video","width":16,"image":null}]},{"company":"charmCityJS, November 2017","description":["This talk was a response to that whole thing where Facebook changed up the licensing of React (and other projects) in a way that created a lot of confusion about people's liability. Many people working in software have only a cursory knowledge of how software IP works, so it felt like a good time to review the basics of IP law and how it affects us. In a blistering 25 minutes I rampaged through the concepts of Copyright, Fair Use, Licenses, Patents, Patent Grants and then the issues surrounding Facebook's actions and what they meant (spoiler: it's a bit unclear but it might be fine but I am not your lawyer)."],"id":"COPYWHAT","title":"Copywhat? Licenses, Patents and that Weird React Thing","clips":[]},{"company":"charmCityJS, February 2017","description":["D3 is an incredible tool that many developers find intimidating at first. This talk was a basic tutorial in making a bar chart in D3, but with a focus on how you don't need to understand all of D3 in order to be very proficient in using it. I also highlighted the awesome amount of examples on bl.ocks.org and how you could use them as both inspiration and as a starting point for your own visualizations."],"id":"INTROD3","title":"Introduction to D3.js","clips":[]},{"company":"charmCityJS, December 2016","description":["This talk was a brief intro to working with Three.js. I began with a supercut of some of the amazing stuff the community has made and then went on to a walkthrough of the official Three.js tutorial, showing the results of each step and explaining how each of the new vocabulary terms (Geometry, Materials, Textures, etc.) relate to each other."],"id":"INTROTHREEJS","title":"Three.js and WebGL","clips":[]},{"company":"charmCityJS, March 2016","description":["This is a talk I've given at charmCityJS and the Loyola University ACM series (which was recorded).
