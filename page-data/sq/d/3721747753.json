I built a platform that allowed audiences to fly around a 3D solar system in groups of 5, interacting with characters played by actors from across the east coast, all acting out of their own houses on their own devices using whatever they had available for setting, props and costumes. The apps involved had to work on desktop, tablet and even mobile browsers (many actors were using phones since they have better webcams) and had to adapt to changing network conditions and unpredictable user device constraints. This is the most technological complicated project I've ever worked on, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.</p>\n","<p>You can read more about this show (and my process for building all the tech it ran on) on <a href=\"/blog/2020/06/16/unshattering-the-audience-building-theatre-on-the-web-in-2020\">my blog</a>.</p>\n"],"id":"14cbe39c-6ec1-587a-bd62-a75b2e1053d2","title":"Shattered Space","url":null,"clips":[{"height":9,"id":"shattered-trailer","src":"https://cdn.chrisuehlinger.com/show-videos/ShatteredTrailer2-transcoded.mp4","type":"video","width":16,"image":null},{"height":9,"id":"shattered-ai-demo","src":"https://cdn.chrisuehlinger.com/show-videos/shattered-ai-demo.mp4","type":"video","width":16,"image":null},{"height":9,"id":"shattered-teaser","src":"https://cdn.chrisuehlinger.com/show-videos/shattered-teaser.mp4","type":"video","width":16,"image":null},{"height":9,"id":"shattered-demo","src":"https://cdn.chrisuehlinger.com/show-videos/shattered-demo.mp4","type":"video","width":16,"image":null}]},{"company":"Fells Point Corner Theatre, January 2020","description":["Role: Projections Designer, Engineer, Video Editor (also staged and shot some of the video pieces)","Tech: Express, Websockets, QLab, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, WebRTC, Nexrender, Raspberry Pi","This show consisted of about 50 sketch-length pieces about communication and relationships in the digital age.
